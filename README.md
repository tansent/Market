A holder-oriented app, super easy to maintain and expand:

The most noteworthy technique in this app is that I have separated and decoupled this app to a great degree. Running the app you can see many pages, some has customized views inside, some is a relatively complicated introduction and downloading fragment. Yet, in the code, there is no massive class with all the adapters, holders, downloading and JSON parsing code jammed all together . I have used interface, abstracted methods, generic type to decouple so that if there is any need to expand the app in the future, it can be done in an instant.

Other features in this app include: ActionBar, Searching, Drawer, Value Animation, Customized views and components.
